# RikardQLAssignment

Use any of the following technologies to implement the UI: ASP.NET MVC, Angular, Vue.js, ReactJS. Use either node.js,
.NET 4.5+ (full framework) or .NET Core to implement the backend as a Web API.
Use JavaScript or C# as server language and JavaScript as client language. Any additional third-party framework may
be used on the client side. On the server-side no third-party framework should be necessary. Data will be stored either
in an MSSQL (express) database, MongoDB or DocumentDB - or read from a file on disk using an appropriate Reader
(imagine that the data set would be much larger than it actually is in this assignment). Include setup instructions for
the data source.
